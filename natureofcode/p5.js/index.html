        <h1>Processing p5.js sketches</h1>
        <p>
            Playing with processing and p5.js, including exercises from Daniel
            Shiffman's (excellent) <a href="https://natureofcode.com">Nature of
            Code</a> book.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="./camera/index.html">Camera</a>: a basic panning
                camera, originally implemented in Processing, and converted
                before I realised <code>orbitControl()</code> existed in p5.js.
                Also allows showing a bounding box to aid orientation, and a
                starting location.

                <a href="./gaussian_paint_dots_3d/index.html">Gaussian Paint
                Dots (3D)</a>: a simple 3D animation that generates 500 randomly
                coloured spheres, whose locations are normally distributed
                around origin.
