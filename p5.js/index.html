        <h1>Processing p5.js sketches</h1>
        <p>
            Playing with processing and p5.js, including exercises from Daniel
            Shiffman's (excellent) <a href="https://natureofcode.com">Nature of
            Code</a> book.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="./camera/index.html">Camera</a>: a basic panning
                camera, originally implemented in Processing, and converted
                before I realised <code>orbitControl()</code> existed in p5.js.
                Also allows showing a bounding box to aid orientation, and a
                starting location.

                <a href="./gaussian_paint_dots_3d/index.html">Gaussian Paint
                Dots (3D)</a>: a simple 3D animation that generates 500 randomly
                coloured spheres, whose locations are normally distributed
                around origin.
            </li>

                <a href="./noc_3.1_angular_motion/index.html">Exercise 3.1:
                Angular Motion</a>: a super simple 2D sketch introducing angular
                rotation in processing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="./noc_3.2_pointing_follower/index.html">Example 3.2:
                A Pointing Follower</a>: a simple follower object that
                accelerates towards the mouse, but also points in the direction
                it is moving.
            </li>

                <a href="./noc_3.2_pointing_vehicle/index.html">Exercise 3.2:
                A Pointing Vehicle</a>: a user controllable "vehicle".

            <li>
                <a href="./noc_3.4_polar_spiral/index.html">Exercise 3.4:
                Polar Spiral</a>: generating a spiral: an example of where using
                polar co-ordinates is preferable to cartesian.
